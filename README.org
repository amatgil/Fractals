#+TITLE: Svg Fractal Generator
#+AUTHOR: Amat Gil
#+OPTIONS: toc:1

This Rust library offers functions that, given the iteration count and extra fractal-dependent variables, return a `String` containing the raw svg content. It mainly targets `wasm`
for reasonably (for some definition of reasonable) easy use in my [site](https://amatgil.cat).

Fractals included so far include:
- Sierpinski's triangle
- Vonkoch's snowflake
- Basic Tree
- Pythegoras' tree

With more to come!

* Basic definitions

The rule only gets executed if `n` is non-zero. When called recursively, it is implicitly decremented.

| Fractal      | Axiom             | Rules                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sierpinski's | One point         | Move the appropriate side-length length 60ยบ and 0ยบ and draw yourself. If n == 0, become a triangle                                                                              |
| Vonkoch's    | Three points      | For each adjacent pair of points, find three more such that a new inline equilateral triangle exists                                                                            |
| Basic Tree   | A vertical line   | Draw two branches angled theta and -theta in relation to their root                                                                                                             |
| Pythagoras'  | A horizontal line | Draw a square whose base is the line. Draw a triangle on top such that one of the angles is theta and the opposite one is 90ยบ. Repeat using the other triangle's edges as roots |


* Usage

Clone it, obviously

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/amatgil/KochSnowflake
#+END_SRC

Compile the wasm:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
just web # Requires just to be installed (cargo install just)
#+END_SRC

The `justfile` contains some other convenience functions, not strictly necessary
